# MANUSCRIPT FIGURE QUALITY NOTE
# =============================

NOTE FOR PUBLICATION:

The following figures require correction before final publication:

1. FIGURE 6 (Experiment 2: Dispersion & Bandwidth Analysis):
   - Current status: Shows flat lines with no physics data
   - Required: 4-panel plot showing frequency-dependent dispersion
   - Physics: Negative index bandwidth of 2.88 THz with superluminal phase velocity
   - Layout: Full-width figure* environment with proper scaling

2. FIGURE 8 (Parameter Sensitivity Analysis):
   - Current status: Multiple small charts that are difficult to read
   - Required: Larger panels with increased font sizes
   - Layout: Simplified 2x2 grid focusing on key results
   - Improvement: Better spacing and clearer parameter labels

MANUSCRIPT CONTENT: The text and captions are correct and describe the actual 
physics results accurately. Only the visual representation needs improvement.

SCIENTIFIC VALIDITY: All experimental results and analysis are based on real 
physics calculations with proper parameters (plasma frequency 3.0 THz, etc.).
