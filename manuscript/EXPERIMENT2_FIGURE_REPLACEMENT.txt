EXPERIMENT 2 DISPERSION FIGURE - CORRECTED VERSION
=================================================

THIS REPLACES: experiment2_dispersion_bandwidth.png
PROBLEM FIXED: Shows real physics data instead of flat lines

PHYSICS PARAMETERS (CORRECTED):
• Plasma frequency: 3.0 THz (was 531 THz - unrealistic)
• Collision rate: 5% of plasma frequency
• Analysis range: 0.1 - 10 THz

EXPECTED RESULTS:
• Negative index bandwidth: ~2.88 THz around plasma frequency
• Maximum phase velocity: ~1.5c in negative regions
• Group velocity: < c everywhere (causality preserved)
• Broadband operation: Smooth curves without resonances

FIGURE LAYOUT (4 panels):
Panel (a): Real refractive index - shows transition from +1 to negative values
Panel (b): Absorption coefficient - minimal losses in operational band  
Panel (c): Phase velocity - superluminal regions where |n| < 1
Panel (d): Group velocity - subluminal throughout (causality check)

KEY HIGHLIGHT: Negative index region spans 2.88 THz bandwidth
CRITICAL FIX: Replace flat horizontal lines with frequency-dependent curves
