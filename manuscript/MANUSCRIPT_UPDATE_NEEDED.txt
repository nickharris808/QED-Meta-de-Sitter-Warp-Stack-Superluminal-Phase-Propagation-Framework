MANUSCRIPT FIGURE UPDATE INSTRUCTIONS
====================================

To display the corrected figures in the manuscript:

OPTION 1: Replace PNG files directly
1. Replace paper/experiment2_dispersion_bandwidth.png with corrected version
2. Replace paper/experiment4_parameter_sensitivity.png with improved layout
3. Recompile manuscript

OPTION 2: Update figure references in manuscript
1. Change \includegraphics{experiment2_dispersion_bandwidth.png} 
   to \includegraphics{experiment2_dispersion_VISUAL.txt}
2. Change \includegraphics{experiment4_parameter_sensitivity.png}
   to \includegraphics{experiment4_parameter_VISUAL.txt}

CURRENT STATUS:
• Manuscript text: ✅ Accurately describes corrected physics
• Figure captions: ✅ Match real experimental results  
• PNG files: ❌ Still contain problematic data
• Visual replacements: ✅ Created with real physics

WHAT NEEDS TO BE DONE:
The manuscript references the original PNG files which still show:
- Figure 6: Flat lines instead of dispersion curves
- Figure 8: Cramped layout instead of readable charts

The corrected visual representations are available in:
- experiment2_dispersion_VISUAL.txt (real physics curves)
- experiment4_parameter_VISUAL.txt (improved layout)
