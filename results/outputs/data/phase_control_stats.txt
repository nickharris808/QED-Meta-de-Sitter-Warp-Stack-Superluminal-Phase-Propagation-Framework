Enhanced Phase Control Monte Carlo Results
========================================

Sample size: 10,000
Network nodes: 4 (reduced from 6)
RMS phase error: 32.6 fs
99th percentile: 183.6 fs
Success rate: 100.00%
Target threshold: 1000 fs (1 ps)
Improvements: Kalman filtering, two-way sync, fewer nodes
